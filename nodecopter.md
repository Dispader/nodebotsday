# Welcome to Nodecopters!
The quadcopters are the Parrot rolling spiders.  They use bluetooth low energy and can be controlled with JavaScript!

There are three examples to try.

- copter-start.js, which is a simple take off and land routine
- copter-kitchensink.js, which will do a little bit of everything.
- copter-wiimote.js, which will allow you to control the copter with a wiimote.

To see the full list of commands, check out the [node-rolling-spider](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-rolling-spider) library on github.
